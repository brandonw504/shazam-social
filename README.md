# Shazam Social

## Overview
An iOS social media app in which users can use Shazam to find songs playing in the environment and share it with their friends through a post.

## Installing the App
This app requires an Apple Developer account to use ShazamKit and an Apple Music subscription if you'd like to play music from the posts. Clone the repository, navigate to the directory shazam-social in the Terminal, and run pod install. Then, open shazam-social.xcworkspace. Plug in an Apple device to your computer and pick that device from the list of simulators to run on. You may need to trust Developer apps to run in Settings. Run the app from Xcode. Run the app once, and then you can enable ShazamKit by selecting the app named \[your name\].shazam-social and checking the box for ShazamKit. You're all done! Run the app again to start using it.

## Using the App
Sign up for an account. On the homepage, you'll be able to see posts by other people who Shazamed songs. To make your own post, tap the + in the top right corner. Once you've Shazamed the song, you can add a caption and a location to your post. Tap "Share Post" and you're all set! You can listen to any of the songs on your feed with Apple Music by tapping on the tile. You'll need an Apple Music subscription for this.

## Future Plans
In the future, I plan to:
- Switch to Protocol Oriented Programming.
- Implement a follower and following system.
- Implement likes and comments.
- Add a world map in with markers for all the posts in users' feeds so they can see all of them at once.
